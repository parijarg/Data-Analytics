    "Accessibility: Natural language queries make it easier for users at all levels of technical proficiency to access and analyze data without needing to know SQL or other query languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "User-Friendly Interface: Users can simply type questions or commands in plain language, making the interface more intuitive and user-friendly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Faster Insights: Users can quickly get answers to their questions without having to build complex queries manually, thereby speeding up the insights generation process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Increased Adoption: Natural language queries can increase the adoption of BI tools within an organization by making data analysis more approachable to a broader range of users.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reduced Learning Curve: Users who are familiar with the data but not with querying languages can start using the tool immediately without extensive training."
